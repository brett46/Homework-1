        <h3>Our team interviewed several people in the class, as well as our coaches and three other teammates.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Our coach brough up several concerns, such as the availability of processed statistics while the game is still going on. He would love to have a program that just tracks pitching statistics, but if we could incorporate batters in the program, we can have more nuanced stats. </li>
            <li>Our pitching coach was interested in how much more efficient the program can make our tracking, as right now all our tracking is done on paper, and our system is a bit confusing for a lot of people.</li>            
            <li>One of our teammates, Andy Diaz, also had some helpful input. He said that it would be helpful for looking back on the day after pitching, becuase right now there is no way to look at your stats the day of pitching.</li>
            <li>Daniel Ramsay, our former coach, also had some ideas. He knows that many of the coaches all use the same stat sheets and are willing to share, so if we can make a system to enter stats which has a similar format to that sheet, we can efficiently convert all our stats to the app.</li>
            <li>Spencer Locati, a senior first baseman, also had some helpful advice. He suggested that we incorporate a native mobile app so that we can download the app and look at statistics even while offline, like while on a road trip with no service.</li>
        </ul>
