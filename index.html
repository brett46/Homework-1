            <p>Liam, Asher, and Brett's project will be to construct a website that Whitworth's baseball team can use to track pitching data. 
                The website will track: balls and strikes. It will crunch those numbers to compute the percentage of strikes thrown by each pitcher.
                Our website will be able to organize data from each pitcher to provide the coaching staff with information on each pitcher and each game.
